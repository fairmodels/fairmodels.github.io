The data used to train modern AI models often contains strong hidden biases, shaping — and limiting — what we recognize as knowledge. In today's world, where large language models (LLMs) influence nearly every field, these biases matter more than ever. [FairTrain](https://fairtrain.github.io) addresses this crucial challenge by collecting diverse texts, audio recordings, and videos in each of the 7,000+ human languages, helping ensure AI systems reflect the rich diversity of global human knowledge.
