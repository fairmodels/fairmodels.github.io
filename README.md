Modern AI systems are trained on datasets that exclude more than 99% of the world‚Äôs living languages. As large language models increasingly shape research, education, industry, and policy, this imbalance determines whose knowledge is visible ‚Äî and whose is erased. [Fairmodels](https://fairmodels.github.io/) is envisioned as an open‚Äësource, community‚Äëowned project that crowdsources and curates openly licensed models and training (text, audio, and video) resources across 7000+ living human languages. By expanding linguistic representation at scale, we work towards a modeling landscape that is more equitable, reliable, and responsive to the needs of every human community.
