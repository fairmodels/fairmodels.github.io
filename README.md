# Fairtrain

Modern AI systems are trained on datasets that exclude more than 99% of the world’s living languages. As large language models increasingly shape research, education, industry, and policy, this imbalance determines whose knowledge is visible — and whose is erased. [Fairtrain](https://fairtrain.github.io/) is envisioned as an open‑source, community‑owned project that crowdsources and curates openly licensed text, audio, and video across more than 7000 living human languages, building training corpora that reflect the full diversity of human knowledge. By expanding linguistic representation at scale, we work toward AI systems that are more equitable, reliable, and responsive to every human community.
