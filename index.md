Modern AI systems are trained on datasets that exclude more than 99% of the worldâ€™s living languages. As large language models increasingly shape research, education, industry, and policy, this imbalance determines whose knowledge is visible â€” and whose is erased. [Fairtrain](https://fairtrain.github.io/) is envisioned as an openâ€‘source, communityâ€‘owned project that crowdsources and curates openly licensed text, audio, and video resources across 7000+ living human languages, enabling training corpora that reflect a richer diversity of global human knowledge. By expanding linguistic representation at scale, we work towards a modeling landscape that is more equitable, reliable, and responsive to the needs of every human community.
